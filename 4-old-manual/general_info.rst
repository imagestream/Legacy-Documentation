FCC Class A Limits
------------------

**Warning**: Changes or modifications to this unit not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance 
could void the user's authority to operate the equipment.

**Note**: This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class A digital device pursuant 
to Part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference 
when the equipment is operated in a commercial environment. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio 
frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instruction manual, may cause harmful interference 
to radio communications. Operation of the equipment in a residential area is likely to cause harmful interference in which 
case the user will be required to correct the interference at his own expense.

**Shielded cables** must be used with this unit to ensure compliance with FCC Class A limits.

Canadian Department of Communications Class A Limits
----------------------------------------------------

This digital apparatus does not exceed the Class A limits for radio noise emissions from digital apparatus set out in 
the Radio Interference Regulations of the Canadian Department of Communications.

Le present appareil numerique n'emet pas de bruits radioelectriques depassant les limites applicables aux appareils 
numeriqqes de la class A prescrites dans le Reglement sur le brouillage radioelectrique edicte par le ministere des 
Communications du Canada.
